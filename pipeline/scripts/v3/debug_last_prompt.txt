. Introduction
Mobility
is defined as
“the ability
to move
oneself (either independentl
y or using
assistive
device or transportation) within
environments
that expand fr
om one’
s
home to
the neighbourhood and regions
beyond” [].
The ability to
move
about the
community
is essential f
or carrying out the instrumental activitie
s of daily li
ving
(i.e. basic
life-maintenance
activities) and ensuring social participation [
].
Growth in
ageing populations is
a global tr
end. A recent
United Nation
s report
states
that the
number of persons aged 
 (or old
er) is expected t
o grow from

million in 

, to .
 billion in 
, and . billion
in []. Accor
ding to the Global
Status R
epor
t on R
oad Safety published b
y The
W
orld Health Organization (WHO
),
approximat
ely .
 million people
around the w
orld die each
year in traffic a
cci-
den
ts [
]. The NHTS
A estimates that
 of serious crashe
s are
due t
o human e
rror
or poor ch
oices—including distracted dri
ving and drunk driving [].
The driving task
necessitates int
eracting with the v
ehicle and the en
vironment
at the
s
ame time
. Many bod
y systems n
eed to be
f
unctional to en
sure the
s
afe
and
timely ex
ecution of the skills req
uired for
driving [

]. Spe
cific factor
s that
contribute
Ethics Laws a
nd Policies for Privacy Secu
rity and Liability

to maint
aining a licen
ce inclu
de vision, ph
ysical health and cognitiv
e health [

].
Researc
h indicate
s that
cognitiv
e abilities
are important
enabling factors f
or safe
driving [

]. R
esearch also indica
tes that
adaptive stra
tegies are essen
tial to maintain
-
ing the normal par
ameters o
f
driving safety
in the face o
f
illness and disability
[

].
Age-rela
ted declines
in the abilities o
f
older adults
provide certain o
bstacles t
o
safe dri
ving. A 
 survey
by the OECD f
ound that  of those  or older
had
stopped driving,
while an
overwhelming number
of those who
continued to driv
e
were
very selectiv
e about whe
n they
did so []. In g
eneral, driving cessation has
been linked t
o increasing age, socioe
conomic fact
ors, and declinin
g function and
health [
]. Negative
effects of driving cessation
on older adults
’ physical, mental,
cognitiv
e, and social functioning hav
e been extensi
vely
st
udied [

–

].
Many a
utomotive
companies
are dev
eloping and/or te
sting driver
less cars.
Largely
, the proposed solu
tions follo
w established automation
models such as
the
six lev
els of automation as
defined by NHTS
A []. Driv
er assistance t
echnology
presents
a potential solution t
o problems
pertaining to drive
r persisten
ce and the
management
of
fitness t
o drive issu
es in older a
dults. As this
technology is no
t
fully implemen
ted and in use
by the public, it
is very diffi
cult to bo
th predict
and
assess its
potential ethical implications and im
pact. Should the purpose
of
these
systems
go beyond saf
ety? Is full aut
omation an appropriate
solution to eff
ectivel
y
managing the app
arent c
onflict betwee
n two
goals—() promoting driver
per-
sistence
and () ensuring road saf
ety? That is, is
it appropriat
e to
enable an older
driver
to continue
driving, ev
en if there is a
risk of a serious
accident
given their
medical background?
With crashe
s also com
es the
question o
f liability
. Currently
,
lawmaker
s are considering
who is
li
able
when an
autonomous car is
involv
ed in an
accident. Suc
h discussions raise man
y comple
x legal and ethical qu
estions. Largely
,
the liter
ature around ethics
and driverless
cars appears to
focus on issues
pertaining
to (
) addressing confli
ct dilemmas on
the road (machine
ethics), () privacy and
() minimising tec
hnology misuse/cy
bersecurity
risks. These
are indee
d important
ethical issues. H
owever
, the liter
ature and public
debate tends
to av
oid other serious
ethical issues—specifically
, issues concernin
g () the int
ended use and purpose of
this tec
hnology
, () the role
of the person/
driver
(including older adult
drivers) and
() is
sues pertaining t
o the po
tential negativ
e consequenc
es of this t
echnology
.
In r
elation to
(), this con
cerns the
social consequences of this t
echnology and
the pote
ntial impact on
older adult iden
tity and w
ell-being. The future
is indeed
unknown. The
advancement o
f new driving solutions
raises overar
ching questions
in rela
tion to
the valu
es of society an
d how w
e design tec
hnology to: (a
) promote
positive
values around ag
eing and enhancing ag
eing experience
, (b) prot
ect human
rights, (
c) ensure human benefit
and (d) prioritise well-
being. Specifically
, it raises
fundamental questions
in relation to
the value w
e place on
promoting autonom
y
and social participation f
or older
adults and optimisin
g quality of life/w
ell-being.
The public
opinion on se
lf-driving cars
(including solutions f
or older
adults) will
determine
the exten
t to
which people
will purchase and a
ccept suc
h syst
ems [

]. W
e
should not pr
oceed with this
technology just beca
use it is a
vailable. Critically
, designers
must carefully
consider the human
dimensions of this t
echnology and its social impli
-
cations.
T
o this end, this chapt
er revie
ws the
relevant ethical conside
rations in
rela
-
tion to
assisted driving solutions. Further
, it presents
a new ethically aligne
d system
concept f
or driver as
sistance. In
so doing, it a
ddresses
the philosophical princip
les that
underlie th
e proposed drivin
g system
concept, and specifically
, the role of the pe
rson.
. Ethics, right
s, digital ethics and ont
ological design
Ethics conc
erns the
moral principles that go
vern a per
son

s beha
viour or how an
activity is
conducted [

]. A k

in ethics is

which
is unethical and that
which is unde
sirable.
Primarily
, moral principles apply
to a person. H
owev
er, m
oral code can
also be
ascribed to the
behaviour of automat
ed or intelligent
systems
(A/IS). Accordingly
,
driver
less cars
are termed
‘artificial moral agents’
.
The U
niver
sal Declaration o
f human rights (
) enshrines all person
s with
human rights
[

]. This include
s rights
pertaining to dignity (
Article ), aut
onomy
(Article ), priv
acy (Article

), and safety
(Article ) [

]. Some w
ould argue
that right
s also a
pply to
technology and artificial agents
. These are r
eferred t
o
as
‘transhuman rights’ [

,

].
To this
end, the field of roboethics has
emerged.
Specifically
, roboethics is
concerned with the
moral behaviour
of
humans as
they
design, construct, use and tr
eat artificially intelligen
t beings.
More
broadly
, ‘
digital ethics’ or
‘information ethics
’ deals with
the impact of
digital Information
and Communication T
echnologies
(IC
T) on our
societies and
the en
vironment
at larg
e [
]. As defined by
Capurro [
], it addresses
the ethical
implications
of things whic
h may
not yet
exist, or things
which
may hav
e impacts
we
cannot pre
dict.
Progress
is typically defined in
relation to con
cepts o
f advancement
and
improv
ement. As stated by
the Organization f
or Economic
Co-Operation and
Developme
nt’
s (
OECD) ‘Being ab
le to
measure people’
s quality of life is
funda
-
mental whe
n assessing the
progress of societies’ [

]. Future tech
nolog
y is
shaping
(and will shape) our politi
cal, social and moral existence
. The application of ethics
to qu
estions concerning tech
nology dev
elopment is not
new
. In his seminal w
ork
‘The Question Conce
rning T
echnology’
, the p
hilosopher Heid
egger sugg
ests that
in
asking what
technology is, w
e ask questions
about w
ho w
e are []. I
n so doing, w
e
examine the
nature of existence and human
autonomy
[]. Such
ideas hav
e led to
the conc
ept of ‘
ontological design
’ which
focuses
on the
‘the relation
between
human
beings and lif
eworlds
’ [

]. As argued by
Winograd an
d Flores, new
technology
does not
simply change
the task, it change
s wha
t it mean
s to
be human [

]. Put
simply
, we
are designe
d by our
designing and by that
which
we hav
e designed [

].
The Inf
ormation
T
echnology (IT) sector is takin
g some leaps
in relation
to
addressing the
se questions
. Currently
, there is a lar
ge f
ocus on is
sues pertaining t
o
well-
being, data
pr
ivacy
and cybersecurity
. In 
, Amazon, Google, Fa
cebook,
IBM, and Microsoft ha
ve established a
non-profit partnership
(i.e. the Partnership
on Artificial Inte
lligence
to Bene
fit Peop
le and Society) to
formulate best
prac
-
tices on
ar
tificial intellige
nce t
echnologies
[

]. Further
, the IEEE Standards
Association has
recently
ar
ticulated a
desire to cr
eate t
echnology that impro
ves
the human
condition and prioritises
well-being. Spe
cifically
, the ‘IEEE G
lobal
Initiativ
e on Ethics of A
utonomous and I
ntelligent S
ystems
’ hav
e defined a set o
f
core ethical prin
ciples f
or aut
onomous and int
elligent s
ystems (A/IS). As stat
ed in
‘Ethically Aligned De
sign (EAD
e), A Vision
for Prioritizing H
uman W
ell-being
with A
utonomous and I
ntelligent S
ystems’ [

]
‘for exte
nded intellige
nce and
automation
to provably
advance a
specific benefit for
humanity, the
re needs
to be
clear indicat
ors of that
benefit’
. Further
, the IEEE Global Initiativ
e argue tha
t
‘the
world
’
s top
metric of value (G
ross Domestic
Product) must mov
e beyond GDP
,
to holisticall
y measure
how intelligent
and autonomous sy
stems can
hinder or
improv
e human well-
being’ [

].
. W
ell-being, identity
, quality of life and self
-
efficacy
The concept
of
identity
has three pillars: the
person, the role and the
group
[

]. Personal id
entity r
efers
to the concept
of the self which dev
elops over
time
and the life-sp
an. This inc
ludes
the aggrega
te of charact
eristics by
which a pe
rson

nd Policies for Privacy Secu

is recognise
d by himself/her
self
and others, w
hat matters t
o the person and th
eir
values [
]. Crucially
, autonomy
is central to per
sonal identity [].
Accordin
g to the
‘Six-fact
or Model o
f
Psychologi
cal W
ell-being’
, six factor
s
contribute
to an
individual’
s psyc
hological well-
being, contentment, and happine
ss
[

]. This
includes positiv
e relationships with
others, personal mastery
, autonom
y, a
feeling o
f purpose and meaning in lif
e, and personal gro
wth and dev
elopment [

].
Quality of life
is inextricably conne
cted to
well-bein
g. As de
fined by th
e OECD
,
well-
being can be
defined/measured in
relation to (
) quality of life (i.
e. health
status, personal security
, social connection
and participation/activity
, w
ork/life
balance, subjectiv
e well-
being, envir
onmental quality
, etc.), and () material condi-
tions (i.
e. income
and wealth, job
and earnings and housing) [
].
Self-efficacy
is defined as a
person’
s belief in his or her
own ability to
accom-
plishing a task
or succeeding in specifi
c situations. One
’
s sense of self-effi
cacy can
play
a major role in
how one approac
hes goals
, tasks, and challenges.
T
he promo
tion
of self-efficacy
is a key
element for su
ccess
in interv
entions designed to
reduce
depressiv
e symptoms
in late
life [

].
. Succe
ssful ageing
The beginning of old age
is between th
e age
of
 or 
 []. Definitions
of old age ar
e multi-dimensional and inclu
de a
combination o
f chronological,
functional and social definitions [
]. Older adults are
a highly heter
ogeneous
group. Often, o
lder adult
s are
segmented based on
factors
such as
ageing
phases, lev
els of fitness, sev
erity of ph
ysical limitations, mobility p
atterns
and
social activities. Ac
cording to
Rowe and Kah
n, successful ag
eing is multidi
-
mensional, encompas
sing the a
voidance of disease and disability
, the main
te
-
nance o
f high phy
sical and cognitive function, and sustained en
gagement
in
social and productiv
e activities [
].
The prevale
nce of mental health
issues is high
in older adults
as compared with th
e
general population
[

]. Older adults
are at risk f
or dev
eloping anxiety and depres
-
sion, given
increased frailty
, medical illnesses and medication
and the potential for
loss, redu
ced social connection and tr
auma (arisin
g from injuries/a
ccidents such
as
falls). On the
other hand, y

generally
happier with a stron

Growth in

. Driving task
The driving is
not a task isolat
ed from everyda
y life. I
t occurs
for a purpose (t

, to see the sc

undertaken in parallel
with other

The driving task

the visual and a
uditory sen
ses. The
information is operat
ed on by many
cognitive
and behavioural pr
ocesses
including short and lon
g-term
memory and judgement,
which
leads to
decisions being made
about driving [

]. Decisions are put
into e
ffect
via the m
usculoskeletal syst
em, which acts
on the st
eering, gear
s and brake
s to
alter
the v
ehicle in rela
tion to
the roa


]. As r
eported by Fuller
, the o
verall pr
ocess is
coordinated
via a com
plex proc
ess in
volving behaviour
, strategic an
d tactical abilities
and personality [
]. As stated in Fuller’
s task capability
model (), loss
of
control
arises w
hen the
demand of the driving t
ask exce
eds the dri

s capability
[].
. Older a
dult drivers
It is
estimated that by
, a quarte
r of all drive

older than  [].
Further
, by 
, more than
 of

 will be dri

h
indicates
a general increase
in both
car acces
s and licensin
g rates
in the o
lder

]. This increase is
mainly attributable t
o significant
increases
in the
number of older
female driver
s [].
A number of studies
hav
e sought to
categorise older a
dults in terms
of their
phy
sical abilities [] their
economic, geograp
hic/spatial and activit
y patterns [

],
use of cars as
a transportation mode
[

], and lif
estyles and associated req
uirements

nuanced categorisation is
that of the

].
The segments take

and transition points int

account.
T
he fiv

er significantly acc
ording to

. Older ad
ult driving challenges
As w

face decisions as
to whether
we
should () continue, () limit, or
() stop

can be treated
as obstacle
s

The path

, since 

moved
towar

, with fea
tures that
enable driver

s
tay
in lane, along
with adaptiv

, and the ability
to self-par

Automa
ted driving sy
s
tems
are defined as sy
s
tems
that contr
ol longitudinal and
lateral motions
of the vehicle

[

]. Self-driving cars use
a combina-
tion of sensors, came
ras, radar
and artificial intelligence
(AI) to tra
vel betw
een
destinations
without a
human operat
or
. The Society of Aut
omotive Engineer

has defined six
levels of driving assistan

•  No aut
omation
•  Driver assistanc
e
•  Partial automation
•  Conditional automation
•  High aut

•  Full automation
In a
ddition, BASt
[

(NHTSA) [
] have
defined equivalent standar

Many a

includes
Audi, BMW

T
his lev
el involv
es an automa
ted driving sy
stem (
ADS) which
can perform
all driving tasks under c
ertain circumstance
s, such
as parking the car
.
In the

driver must
be read

or switched off by the

As note
d earlier
, technology inno

and raises
ethical questions. As
posed by BMVI, how
much d

complex

achieve, in

increased safety
,
mobility and c

clusters of issues, (

Largely
, the liter
ature around ethics
and driverless
cars appears to
focus
on a su
bset of important ethical issu
es. This
includes issues
pertaining to ()
addressing c
onflict dilemmas
on the r

and protecting personal
sphere, (
) minimising technology misuse and (

The issue
of
managing conflict dilem
mas on the
road poses significant
chal
-
lenges
for autonomous
vehi
cles. As
outlined in the
literature
, operational
decision making raise
s many
serious questions in
terms of how human
life is
valued. Equally
, such
solutions raise
significant ethical questions in
terms of
data priv
acy and the
sharing of sensitive/private
information about a
person’
s
health condition
and potential driving risk.
The possibility of technology
hacking is
also a pot
ential threat to
the implemen
tation of this t
echnology
.
Further
, issues around defining rig
hts in
the cont
ext of the a
ugmented self (i.e.
the mix
of human rights
and rights as
apply to our
digital self
which
is enabled/
transformed b
y the r
each of artificial technology) are real. As
argued by some,
we
may ha
ve to
devise a set o
f ethics that applie
s to
the w
hole continuum
of our digital self and identity
. Pote
ntially
, the specification o
f a Univ

Declaration o
f
Transhuman

the dev
elopment of these
technologies
. Data gathered in
a rece

.. Positiv
e ageing and self-efficacy
The proposed co-
pilot syst
em is premised on c
oncepts o
f
successful/positiv
e
ageing and self
-efficacy
. Although certain conditions
occur in
old age (
and impact
on the
driving task), old age
itself is not a disease. A
geing (and the associated
changes
in functional, sensory and cognitive
function) is a normal part of life.
To
this end, the
system seeks t
o normalise
ageing, and no
t treat
ageing as a
‘problem’ or
‘
disease’
. The
driving solution (i.e. car
, sensor sy
s
tem, co-pilo
t and HMI) is d
esigned
to optimise
the abilities and participation
of older adults
. That is, it a
ddresses
what
older ad
ul
ts can
do as opposed to
focusing on d
eclining capacities
.
.. Ability
, adaption and assistance (
not automation)
The co-pilot
is conceptualised as a
means/intervention
to ensure tha
t older
adults dri
ve
safely
and for long
er. Critically
, the t
echnology supports
continued and
safe dri
ving for all a
dults, inclu
ding those adult
s at ris
k of limiting their driving
and/or gi
ving up. According
ly
, concepts of ability
, adaption and as
sistance (as
opposed to
vehicle
automation) underpin the
system logic.
T
o achieve
this, the
proposed tech
nology provid
es diffe
rent lev
els of assistance, tailore
d to the
older
adults (
) ability, (
) health and () the
real-time phy
sical and psychological/
emo-
tional health. In g
eneral, this will d
eliver
benefits for th
e wider
population and not
just older
adults.
.. Interpretat
ion of
driver profile and r
eal-time c
ontext
The ability
of the driv
er to
perform the driving t
ask depends
on the dri
ver’
s
ability (i.
e. functional, sensory and cognitive), his
or her driving experienc
e and
the
‘real time’ state o
f
the driv
er (i.e
. health, level of fatigue, emotional stat
e, etc.)
and the operational c
ontext (i.
e. cabin context, r
oad context, w
eather and traf-
fic). Thus, t
o provid
e target
ed task support to the
driver
, the system
combines (
)
an underst
anding of the driv
er’
s profile (i.
e. ability
and driving experience) and
() an int
erpretation
of the real time c
ontext (i.
e. the state
of the driv
er and the
operational
conte
xt).
.. Focus on i

The critical objectiv
e for the s
ystem
is not
to pre

.. Role of driver in the syst
e
m and adap
tive au
tomation
The proposed sy
s
tem
maintains the
autonomy
of the individual. In
principle,
the driv
er is able t
o choose
(and/or switch o
ff
) task support and a
dvanced lev
els
of automation, if they so
choose. Overall, w
e are starting from the
point of the
engaged dri
ver
, who has
capacity and ability
. In this
way
, the syste
m supports a
vision of the old
er adult
driver
as ‘in c
ontrol’
. The r
ole of the driver
is to wor
k in
partnership with
the ‘
co-pilot’
, to achie
ve
a safe
and enjoyable driv
e. Critically
, the
system
treats the driv
er as
‘
capable’ and ‘in
charge’ unless it
detects that the
driver
is incapa
citated and/
or there
is a potential f
or a saf
ety critical ev
ent (i.e. lev
el 
assistance/saf
ety critical intervention). I
f the system
detects that the
driver is in
a seriously
impaired state and/
or incapacitated, or
that a
safety criti
cal event
is
imminent, then
the principle
of
‘
driver
autonomy’ is outw
eighed by that o

.
In su
ch cases
, authority m

’

.. Driver as a person (holistic approac
h)
The proposed drivin
g assistance sy
stem is premised on
a conceptualisation of
the driv
er/older a
dult as a
person and not a
set of symptoms/conditions
(i.e. holistic
approach). Spe
cifically
, biopsychosocial concepts
of
health and w
ellness inform the
logic of the pr
oposed driving assistance
system. The sy
stem is concern
ed with all
aspects of the dri
ver’
s wellness
, including the
driver’
s ph
ysical, social, cognitive an
d
emotional health.
.. Diversity in o
lder adult popula
tion
Critically
, the driving assistance
system logic
is premised on the id
ea that
all
older ad
ul
t driv
ers are not
the same. Older a
dult driv
ers vary in
many
way
s includ-
ing body
size and shape, str
ength, mobility, se
nsory acuity
, cognition, emotions
,
driving experience
, driving ability (and challeng
es) and confidence
. In relation
to drivin
g situation and ability
, we
have segm
ented older
adults into the
following
high-profile
s or clust
ers
—as indicat

profiles hav
e been further
specified in re
lation to
a series of personae. Criticall

As highligh
ted by
Fry, the
introduction of new t
echnology has
the potential to
transform
what
it means t
o be human [

]. In this wa
y, the
introduction of new
assisted driving solutions
presents a
challenge
to our
being. Design
decisions are
normativ
e—they reflect
societal values concernin
g human agen
cy and human iden-
tity/a
voiding ageism. In
particular
, they provide
an opportunity to fost
er quality

or older adults
as they age
, and to pr
omote positi

sign/technology
teams thus
exercise choice
in relation t
o wha
t is
valued and adv
ancing techn
ology
that impr
oves
the human condition
(and not w
orsens it).
The discov
ery and utilisation of fire
by earl

was of course transforma

and positive [

]. It s
haped how
we ea
t, kept w

ever
, less examined are
the negative
by-produ

came with
fire,
and the wa

hich humans may
or may not
have a


]. In
the

is important that d
esigners c
onsider issu
es pertaining to
potential tech-
nology impa
ct in te
rms of the thr
ee strands of health and w
ellness (i.
e. biological,
psychological and social health). I
n particular
, designers should c
onsider pro
tec-
tions conc
erning the
‘unknown’ future
implications of this techn
ology (includin
g
the pote
ntial negativ
e social consequ
ences).
In r
elation to
the introduction o
f other consumer an
d information t
echnologies
(for exam
ple, mobile
phones and social media
), many im
portant questions
were
posed ‘post
hoc’
. As stat
ed by H
eraclitus, ‘One
cannot step twice
in the same riv
er’
[].
T
hese t
echnologies hav
e resulted in man
y changes t
o previously estab
lished
social norms. Arguably
, social norms in
relation t
o identity and priva
cy and
associated informa
tion sharing, ha
ve appeared t
o change—and without serious
questioning of the im
plications o
f this. Further
, in its
early stag
e, designers need
not proper
ly consider the
potential social consequ
ences
of this technology
(for
example, social isolation
and depression).
Nonetheles
s, just beca
use the hor
se has bolted (i.e
. the aut
omotive industry
is
currently
advancing and t
esting driverless
cars), does not mean
there is nothing
to be
achieved and/or
that we ar
e powerless
. As mentioned previously
, the a
vail-

mean that w

no choice
. Critically,
we ne

g design assumption
s from

well-
being and rights. I
n this regard, the
IEEE Global Initiative r

this direction.
Salganik proposes
a hope-based and principle-based appr

in Social

is not
enough! As evid

, human

owev

e are other c

pose chal

to safe driving
, and others still that make
it unsafe to

proposed
solution is
designed to
directly address
this fact—to
promote driv

and enablement
in these differe

while sim

Human ben

an important g

human rights.
In t
erms of rights
, this includes the
rights of () older a

and () other
road users
and pedestrians who ma

and specifically
, heal

, as driving system

n this wa

, the proposed

, the co-pilot

.
 Personalisation and ro
le of AI
Many neg
ative
driving experiences ar
e linked t
o frustrations
with the
vehic
le
not being configure
d for the
driver
. Drivers ar
e highly div
erse in terms
of
size,
strength, angle
of
vision and experie
nce of differ
ent vehicle
s. Older dri
vers
present
even
greater div
ersity when
limitations of movement, hearin
g, eye
sight, memory
emerge. I
t is argued that
personalisation is
central to foste
ring a positiv
e driver
experience. F
or example, v
ehicle sensors can
be used to dete
ct which
driver is
driving and to
adjust the v
ehicle par
ameters
according
ly (i.
e. angle
of
mirrors, st
eer-
ing wheel, sea
t, etc.). Moreo
ver
, personalisation offers
an enormous opportunity
to ensur
e that task support and m
ul
timodal feedbac
k is configured according t
o
knowledg
e of the particular dri
ver’
s ability (in
cluding sensory
ability), driving
routines
and routes
and typical challenges/errors
.
A human-centric and ethi
cally aligned design
philosophy nec
essitates
continu-
ous learning on
the behalf of the assistance
system (i.e
. including AI/machine
learning). If the assistance
system can learn
about those situations
and tasks that
prov
e challengin
g and/or str
essful for the
older adult driv
er (i.e. driving in
traffic,
poor visibility
, changing lanes
, parking and so forth, etc.), then
it can tailor
the task
support that it
provides to
the driver
. This tailor
ed task support is
predictive/intel-
ligent, ensuring that
the driver
persists in
challenging driving situations, w
hile also
enjoying their dri
ve.
. R
ole of human factors
New
technology raises c
omplex ethical q
uestions. Assessin
g the ethical impli
-
cations of things
which
may not
yet exist, or
things which ma
y hav
e impacts
we
cannot pr
edict, is v
ery difficult. Howev
er, this
should not be barrier t
o posing
important que
stions and ensuring that
these questions ar
e addressed as part
of
the design
process. Typically
, the human
factors discipline is
concerned with
issues ar
ound intended use, user int
erface d
esign and te
chnology ac
ceptability
. As
demonstrated in
this research, human
factors
research
should extend its remit
to
include
examination of ethical issues pertaining to
new technology
, and specifi
-
cally
, how w
ell-being, rig
hts and human value/benefit
should be considered in
terms o
f
design solutions
. In this
way
, HF methods can be
used to pr
ovide some
protections
to ensur
e that
ethical issues
are conside
red. As de
monstrated in
this
research, the
application of a personae/
scenario-based design approa
ch allows us
to consid
er the ethical dimension o
f these technologie
s. Further
, the translation
of system

associated metrics—ensures that
well-being and human
benefit is
both a refe
rence
point and a
design out
come. W
e may
not ha
ve certainty
as regards
potential future
technology
impact, but at least
we
are asking important
questions so as
to pav
e the
way
for an ethically
aligned technology of which
well-being and human
value is
a
cornerstone
. The de
sign and impleme
ntation o
f ethically aligned techno
logy takes
leadership
and education. It also
requires
adopting a multi-disciplinary perspe
ctive
and ensuring div
erse disciplines are
involv
ed in solution
design (inc
luding persons
trained in ethics
and moral reasoning). Further
, a crucial element
of
the de
sign
process
to ensur
e an ethical product
is rigorous
experimentation in a
simulator
using a co-design
approach.
.
 Next steps
The initial concept
requires further elaboration
and specification. In line
with a human
factors approac
h, a series
of co-design and evalua
tion sessions
will be undertaken
with end users. In
addition, the proposed solution
will be
evaluated in
using a driving simulator
. A health ev
ent cannot be
induced as
par
t
of a driving simulation
exercise. Ho
wev
er, w
e can evaluate
the overall con
cept,
driver
responses and the usabilit
y of specific dri
ver
input/output c
ommunication
mechanisms.
. Conclusion
s
The proposed de
sign/automa
tion approac
h reflects
an ethically aligned and
principled approach
to a multi-dimensional design
problem. Human benefit,
well-
being and respect f
or human rights
and identity ar
e important goals f
or new
assisted driving t
echnologies. Su
ch sy
stems m
ust also be
verifiably saf
e and secure
.
In this
way
, the solution needs
to carefully balan
ce goals
around safety and human
benefit. As indica
ted in this
research, well-
being and human benefit
goals and
associated KPI are
defined to ensure
that these concepts
are properly
considered in
the design
process, and to e
nsure that
well-being and human
benefit is
a tangible
outcome
of new assisted drivin
g solutions.
Arguably
, existing high au
tomation appr
oaches do not
support positive a
geing.
Crucially
, ‘tech
nology progre
ss’ in c
losely int
ertwined with conc
epts of progress
from a
societal values
perspective. N
ew assisted dri
ving solutions provide
an
opportunity to c
hange/improv
e the liv
ed experience of older a
dults, particularly
in
relation
to au
tonomy
and social participation. Enabling driver
persistence is an
issue
for all o
f society and not just
older adults.
The application
of
new car-
based sensors underpinned by
machine learning
techniqu
es, and innov
ativ
e multimodal HMI communi
cation methods
can support
driver
persistence, driv
er enablement and su
ccessful ageing
. The pr
oposed adap-
tive
automation/co-pilot
concept is pre
dicated on
an analysis
of
the lit
erature and
relevant
ageing data (i.e
. TILDA data
). The co-pilot con
cept and associat
ed innova-
tive
multimodal HMI will be further elaborated using human
factors/stakehold
er
evaluation m
ethods (for
example, participatory co-de
sign and evaluation
in a test
simulator).
It is
anticipated that this
new car-based techno
logy will deliv
er () safe

() driving persist

) an enhanced driver
experience. (

ing is built in

this way
, health monitoring is
not a goal of new

and an enhanced driv

The study's three main objectives are to (1) identify the direction of transcendental law in addressing legal gaps in Indonesia and its relation to abstract goals such as justice, effectiveness, sustainability, and fairness, (2) conduct a gap analysis of legal reform in Indonesia, particularly in the digital era, from the perspective of transcendental law, and (3) propose recommendations for legal reform in Indonesia based on the perspective of transcendental law to achieve justice, effectiveness, sustainability, and fairness in the digital era. The study's hypothesis is that transcendental law can provide a comprehensive perspective on legal reform in Indonesia, particularly in the digital era, to achieve justice, effectiveness, sustainability, and fairness

Transcendental Law and Legal Reform in the Digital Era
Chapter
Full-text available
May 2024
Isman Isman
Ahmad Hambali
Aisha Baha Eldeen
This study aims to examine the contribution of the concept of transcendental law to addressing legal gaps in Indonesia, offering a wider perspective on how the law can be directed towards achieving higher and more abstract objectives such as justice, effectiveness, sustainability, and fairness. Transcendental law is a legal principle that focuses on laws transcending the material and temporal worlds. In the context of converging legal thinking, transcendental law can help reach consensus and shared understanding in addressing legal gaps. In restructuring and transforming the legal system, transcendental law can guide changes that aim to achieve broader goals, such as justice, sustainability, and effectiveness. In the digital era, transcendental law can assist in developing a comprehensive regulatory framework that includes aspects such as privacy, data security, and copyright, while taking into account abstract values such as justice and sustainability. This study uses a literature review methodology and presents recommendations for legal reform in Indonesia. Overall, transcendental law provides a comprehensive outlook on how the law can be directed towards achieving larger and more abstract goals, contributing to legal reform in Indonesia.

Should Electronic Medical Records Be an Alternative to Reference Intervals for Interpretation of Laboratory Results in Geriatric Subjects?
Chapter
Jul 2020
Sudip Kumar Datta
Reliable reference intervals (RI) and clinical decision limits (CDL) are indispensable for correct interpretations of laboratory results. The problem becomes more evident in geriatric population as these people are often affected by comorbidities, polypharmacy, and atypical disease presentations. With the advent of electronic medical records (EMR) and its wide availability, it becomes a possibility that, some baseline lab and clinical data would always be available which could be used as references, especially, in geriatric people, to evaluate them for chronic diseases. For the meaningful usage of EMR, the records need to be harmonized and available to the health care providers. These records can then be used to differentiate clinically relevant changes in lab investigations over periods of time. Hence, we need to define the percentage differences per unit periods of time or personalized CDL rather than absolute values based on population-based RI especially in the geriatric population. However, issues regarding security and ownership of EMR need to be well defined to prevent unwanted breaches in privacy.

Driver Persistence, Safety and Older Adult Self-efficacy: Addressing Driving Challenges Using Innovative Multimodal Communication Concepts
Chapter
Full-text available
Jul 2020
Joan Cahill
Katie Crowley
Sam D Cromie
Robert Ross
New assisted driving technology provides a solution to enabling driver persistence while also addressing older adult fitness to drive issues. The proposed driver assistance system follows a detailed literature review, an analysis of secondary data, and the specification of a solution using human machine interaction (HMI) design methods. Overall, the assisted driving concept follows from a principled/ethical perspective in relation to promoting self-efficacy and enablement for older adults. The system is conceptualized as a supportive friend or ‘co-pilot’. It is argued that the use of new car-based sensors, along with machine learning intelligence and novel multimodal HMI communication methods will enable driver persistence while also promoting older adult self-efficacy and positive ageing.

Acceptance of Driverless Vehicles: Results from a Large Cross-National Questionnaire Study

Sina Nordhoff

Riender Happee
Shuttles that operate without an onboard driver are currently being developed and tested in various projects worldwide. However, there is a paucity of knowledge on the determinants of acceptance of driverless shuttles in large cross-national samples. In the present study, we surveyed 10,000 respondents on the acceptance of driverless vehicles and sociodemographic characteristics, using a 94-item online questionnaire. After data filtering, data of 7,755 respondents from 116 countries were retained. Respondents reported that they would enjoy taking a ride in a driverless vehicle (mean = 4.90 on a scale from 1 = disagree strongly to 6 = agree strongly). We further found that the scores on the questionnaire items were most appropriately explained through a general acceptance component, which had loadings of about 0.7 for items pertaining to the usefulness of driverless vehicles and loadings between 0.5 and 0.6 for items concerning the intention to use, ease of use, pleasure, and trust in driverless vehicles, as well as knowledge of mobility-related developments. Additional components were identified as thrill seeking, wanting to be in control manually, supporting a car-free environment, and being comfortable with technology. Correlations between sociodemographic characteristics and general acceptance scores were small (<0.20), yet interpretable (e.g., people who reported difficulty with finding a parking space were more accepting towards driverless vehicles). Finally, we found that the GDP per capita of the respondents’ country was predictive of countries’ mean general acceptance score ( ρ=-0.48 across 43 countries with 25 or more respondents). In conclusion, self-reported acceptance of driverless vehicles is more strongly determined by domain-specific attitudes than by sociodemographic characteristics. We recommend further research, using objective measures, into the hypothesis that national characteristics are a predictor of the acceptance of driverless vehicles.

A survey of public opinion about connected vehicles in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia
Conference Paper
Full-text available
Nov 2014
Brandon Schoettle
Michael Sivak
This survey examined public opinion regarding connected-vehicle technology across three large English-speaking countries — the U.S., the U.K., and Australia. The survey yielded useable responses from 1,596 persons over the age of 18. The main results were as follows: • The majority of respondents had not previously heard of connected-vehicle technology; however, most had a positive initial opinion of the technology. • The majority felt that the expected benefits presented in the survey are likely to occur. • Respondents generally expressed a high level of concern regarding the security and performance issues presented in the survey. • The majority of those surveyed stated that safety was the most important aspect of connected vehicles. • Most individuals said that it is important for personal communication devices to integrate with connected vehicles, as well as for such vehicles to have Internet connectivity. • The majority of respondents expressed a desire to have this technology in their vehicle. • Willingness to pay for connected-vehicle technology was very similar across the three countries. The main implications of these results are that the general public in the three countries surveyed feel positive about connected vehicles, have optimistic expectations of the benefits (while still maintaining some concerns), and generally desire connected-vehicle technology when it becomes available.

Becoming Human by Design
Book
Jan 2012
Tony (Anthony) Hart Fry
The last in Tony Fry’s celebrated trilogy of books continues his radical rethinking of design. Becoming Human by Design’s provocative argument presents a revised reading of human ‘evolution’ centred on ontological design.
Examining the relation of design to the nature of the human species - where the species came from, how it was created, what it became and its likely future - Fry asserts that current biological and social models of evolution are an insufficient explanation of how ‘we humans’ became what we are.
Making a case for ontological design as an evolutionary agency, the book posits the relation between the formation of the world of human fabrication and the making of mankind itself as indivisible. It also functions as a provocation to rethink the fate of Homo sapiens, recognising that all species are finite and that the fate of humankind turns on a fundamental Darwinian principle - adapt or die. Fry considers the nature of adaptation, arguing that it will depend on an ability to think and design in new ways.

This study investigated user acceptance, worries, and willingness to buy partially, highly, and fully automated vehicles. By means of a 63-question Internet-based survey, we collected 5,000 responses from 109 countries (40 countries with at least 25 respondents). We determined cross-national differences, and assessed correlations with personal variables, such as age, gender, and personality traits as measured with a short version of the Big Five Inventory. Results showed that respondents, on average, found manual driving the most enjoyable mode of driving. Responses were diverse: 22% of the respondents did not want to pay more than

0 for a fully automated driving system, whereas 5% indicated they would be willing to pay more than
30,000 for it, and 33% indicated that fully automated driving would be highly enjoyable. 69% of respondents estimated that fully automated driving will reach a 50% market share between now and 2050. Respondents were found to be most concerned about software hacking/misuse, and were also concerned about legal issues and safety. More neurotic people were slightly less comfortable about data transmitting, whereas agreeable persons were slightly more comfortable with that. The more developed countries (in terms of accident statistics, education, and income) were less comfortable with their vehicle transmitting data, with cross-national correlations between ρ= -0.80 and ρ= -0.90. The present results indicate the major areas of promise and concern among the international public, and could be useful for vehicle developers and other stakeholders.

Introduction—The Transhumanist FAQ: A General Introduction
Chapter
Jan 2014
Nick Bostrom
Transhumanism is a way of thinking about the future that is based on the premise that the human species in its current form does not represent the end of our development but rather a comparatively early phase. We formally define it as follows:1.
The intellectual and cultural movement that affirms the possibility and desirability of fundamentally improving the human condition through applied reason, especially by developing and making widely available technologies to eliminate aging and to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities.
2.
The study of the ramifications, promises, and potential dangers of technologies that will enable us to overcome fundamental human limitations, and the related study of the ethical matters involved in developing and using such technologies.

Commercial Digital Equipment in Nuclear Plants: The Ethos of a Black Box
November 1995

IFAC Proceedings Volumes
Charles M. Waite
The nuclear industry is faced with the reality that it is no longer a driving market force in the field of digital equipment, and must either design its own equipment to meet stringent quality requirements, or use commercially available equipment that was not specifically designed for “safety-related” applications. But how do we distinguish between good and bad commercially available equipment?

Automated driving solutions represent a potential solution to promoting driver persistence and the management of fitness to drive issues in older adults. This paper reports on the application of a ‘Human Factors & Ethics Canvas’ and associated methodologies, to support the preliminary specification of an ethically responsible solution for a new driver assistance system. The proposed driving

assistance solution has emerged from an analysis of certain ethical principles in relation to the goals and needs of specific older adult drivers (i.e. personae) in different situations (i.e. scenarios). The driving solution is designed to optimize the abilities and participation of older adults.

New assisted driving technology provides a solution to enabling driver persistence while also addressing older adult fitness to drive issues. The proposed driver assistance system follows a detailed literature review, an analysis of secondary data, and the specification of a solution using human machine interaction (HMI) design methods. Overall, the assisted driving concept follows from a

principled/ethical perspective in relation to promoting self-efficacy and enablement for older adults. The system is conceptualized as a supportive friend or ‘co-pilot’. It is argued that the use of new car-based sensors, along with machine learning intelligence and novel multimodal HMI communication methods will enable driver persistence while also promoting older adult self-efficacy and positive ageing.

To examine alternative means of mobility that nondriving older adults rely on and their impact on well-being.
Data from the 2011 (T1, N = 6,680) and 2012 (T2, N = 5,413) interview waves of the National Health and Aging Trends Study were used to examine sample characteristics by driving status, use of alternative mobility resources, and perceived transportation-related barriers among ex-drivers

and nondrivers, and their association with depressive symptoms.
A majority of nondrivers relied on their informal support system and/or paid assistance to drive them to places. About half reported walking/using a wheelchair or scooter. A significant proportion of never drivers also used public transportation and van/shuttle services, whereas a smaller proportion of ex-drivers used them. Nondrivers who walked for transport had lower depressive symptoms than those who did not walk at either T1 or T2, and perception of transportation barriers to visiting friends/family was associated with higher depressive symptoms at T1 only.
Older adults' mobility needs should be met through increasing walkability, public and paratransit transportation, supplemental senior transportation, and increasing informal caregivers-transportation providers' ability to aid older adults.

The objective of this article was to explore trends in licensing among babyboomer older drivers in the state of Victoria, Australia. The study aims were to (1) compare the car licensing trends of the babyboomer cohort to that of previous birth cohorts and (2) predict the number of babyboomers licensed to drive a car in 2021 when the babyboomer cohort reaches an average age of 65 years.
The

residential population of Victoria, Australia, for 2001-2013 was obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics; car licensing statistics were obtained from VicRoads. Birth cohorts from 1916 to 1975 were defined in 10-year birth-year intervals. Population size was modeled using logistic regression. License prevalence was modeled using a logit model.
The babyboomer cohort (1946-1965) in Victoria is 1.7 times larger than the cohort before them. At age 60 years, license prevalence among babyboomers was higher than in previous cohorts: 88% in the 1936-1945 cohort vs. 96% in the 1946-1955 cohort. When the babyboomers reach 65 years (average) in 2021, we estimate there to be over twice as many license holders among them than in the preceding cohort (n = 1,300,094 vs. 630,830, respectively).
Aging of the babyboomer cohort will have a greater impact on the driving population than on the general population, due to the multiplicative effect of cohort size and license prevalence. The impact of road user aging on burden of injury can be minimized by focusing prevention at crashes typical to older drivers, such as intersection crashes, and promoting car safety features among older drivers.
